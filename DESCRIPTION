Description: Implements a specific form of segmented linear regression
    with two independent variables. The visualization of that function looks 
    like a quarter segment of a cowbell giving the package its name. 
    The package has been specifically constructed for the case where minimum 
    and maximum value of the dependent and two independent variables 
    are known a prior, which is usually the case
    when those values are derived from Likert scales.
